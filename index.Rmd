# Preface {-}

This document provides a background and demonstration of the Utah DWQ IR Team's re-development and automation of water quality assessment tools.  
<br>
This document consists of three components:  
1. A background section describing the objectives, tools, and approach to developing new water quality assessment tools.  
2. A full-scale demonstration of the current state of this new toolset via the application of these tools to a subset of water quality parameters from the 2016 IR period of record dataset (2008-2014), and   
3. A series of example data and assessment review and visualization applications.
